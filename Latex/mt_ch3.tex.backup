\section{The Einstein Relation under mm-isomorphisms}

TO DO: This entire section will be rewritten, as the isometry condition appears far too strong.

Recall that by definition, an isomorphism between metric measure spaces $X=(X,d_X,\mu)$ and $Y=(Y,d_Y,\nu)$ (or mm-isomorphism, for short) is an isometry $\gp:\supp\mu\to\supp\nu$ such that the push-forward measure $\gp_*\mu$ coincides with $\nu$, see definition 2.8. in \cite{shioya2016metric}. We point out that such $\gp$ is necessarily a bijection between $\supp\mu$ and $\supp\nu$: Since every isometry is necessarily injective, so too is $\gp$, and we only have to verify surjectivity. To this end, suppose there exists $y\in\supp\nu\setminus \gp(\supp\mu)=:Z$. Since $\supp\mu$ is closed, so is its image under the isometry $\gp$, and hence $Z\ssq \supp\nu$ is open. As every open subset of $\supp\nu$ is required to have positive measure, we obtain the contradiction
\[
  0<\nu(Z)=\gp_*\mu(Z)=\mu\left((\gp^{-1}(\supp\nu\setminus \gp(\supp\mu))\right)=0.
\]
Hence, $f$ is indeed a bijection. In what follows, we will always assume $\supp\mu=X$ and $\supp\nu=Y$. 

Note first that any mm-isomorphism $\gp:(X,d_X,\mu)\to(Y,d_Y,\nu)$ induces by precomposition an operator
\begin{align*}
  \gp_{L^2}:L^2(Y,\nu)&\to L^2(X,\mu)\\
  f(y)&\mapsto(f\circ\gp)(x)
\end{align*}
which is an isometric isomorphism because $\gp^{-1}:(Y,d_Y,\nu)\to(X,d_X,\mu)$ induces its inverse and because of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:isometry}
  \left\|\gp_{L^2}f\right\|_{L^2(X,\mu)}^2
  =\int_X |f(\gp(x))|^2\,\Di\mu
  =\int_Y |f|^2\,\Di\gp_*\mu
  =\int_Y |f|^2\,\Di\nu
  =\|f\|_{L^2(Y,\nu)}^2,
\end{equation}
by the change of variables formula. Denote by $\IL(H)$ the set of all linear operators on the Hilbert space $H$ (not necessarily bounded or everywhere definied). Given an operator $A\in\IL(L^2(X,\mu))$, we can now contruct an operator $\Phi A\in\IL(L^2(Y,\nu))$ by conjugating with $\gp_{L^2}$. More explicitly, we define the map
\[
  \Phi:\IL(L^2(X,\mu))\to\IL(L^2(Y,\mu))
\]
where $(\Phi A)f:=(\gp_{L^2}^{-1}\circ A\circ\gp_{L^2})f$ and $\cD(\Phi A)=\gp_{L^2}^{-1}(\cD(A))$. It follows immediately that $\cD(\Phi A)$ is dense iff $\cD(A)$ is, and $\Phi A$ is self-adjoint iff $A$ is. Indeed, consider arbitrary $f,g\in\cD(\Phi A)$ with $f=\gp_{L^2}^{-1}(\bar f)$ and $g=\gp_{L^2}^{-1}(\bar g)$, where $\bar f, \bar g\in \cD(A)$. Then, applying \eqref{eq:isometry}, we have
\[
  \left<(\Phi A)f,g\right>_{L^2(Y,\nu)}
  =\left<\gp_{L^2}^{-1}A\gp_{L^2}\gp_{L^2}^{-1}\bar f,\gp_{L^2}^{-1}\bar g\right>_{L^2(Y,\nu)}
  =\left<A\bar f,\bar g\right>_{L^2(X,\mu)}
\]
and we can perform the same calculations for $\left<f,(\Phi A)g\right>_{L^2(Y,\nu)}$, thus establishing the claimed equivalence. It is equally easy to check that the resolvent sets and the eigenvalues of $A$ and $\Phi A$ coincide, so we observe that $A$ satisfies assumptions \ref{cond:A} iff $\Phi A$ does. This motivates the following proposition:

\begin{prop}
  Let $(X,d_X,\mu)$ and $(Y,d_Y,\nu)$ be complete separable metric measure spaces with $\supp\mu=X$ and $\supp\nu=Y$ that are mm-isomorphic by virtue of the map $\phi:X\to Y$. Suppose the Einstein relation with constant $c$ holds on $X$ with respect to an operator $(A,\cD(A))$ satisfying assumptions \ref{cond:A}. Then, the Einstein relation also holds on $Y$ with the same constant $c$ and with respect to $\Phi A$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Trivially, $\dimh(X)=\dimh(Y)$, and as observed above, $\dims(X,A)=\dims(Y,\Phi A)$. So, it remains to show $\dimw(X,M)=\dimw(X,M^{(\gp)})$ where $M$ is a Hunt process associated to $A$ and $M^{(\gp)}$ is one associated to $\Phi A$. 
  
  To this end, we remark first that if $(T_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on $L^2(X,\mu)$ with generator $(A,\cD(A))$ then 
  $(\Phi T_t)_{t\geq0}$ is a semigroup with the same properties on $L^2(Y,\nu)$ and with generator $(\Phi A,\cD(\Phi A))$. Indeed, the semigroup property is trivial to check. For strong continuity, we calculate
  \[
    \left\|\Phi T_t f-\Phi T_0 f\right\|
    =\left\|\gp_{L^2}^{-1}(T_t\gp_{L^2}f-\gp_{L^2}f)\right\|
    =\left\|T_t(\gp_{L^2}f)-(\gp_{L^2}f)\right\| \to 0
  \]
  for $t\searrow 0$ for arbitrary $f\in L^2(X,\mu)$, and verifying the generator works analogously. 
  
  In the next step, we consider the process $N_t:=\gp(M_t)$. This process is a Hunt process with values in $Y$, and possesses the semigroup
  \[
    T_t^{(N)}f(y)
    =\PTEp{f(N_t)}{y}
    =\PTEp{(f\circ\gp)(M_t)}{\gp^{-1}(y)}
    =T_t[\gp_{L^2}f](\gp^{-1}(y))
    =\gp_{L^2}^{-1}T_t\gp_{L^2} f
    =\Phi T_t.
  \]
  Thus, up to killing on polar sets the processes $N_t$ and $M^{(\gp)}$ coincide. In particular, we have the equality $\PTEp{\tau_{B(x,r)}}{x}=\PTEp{\tau_{B(\gp(x),r)}^{(\gp)}}{\gp(x)}$ for all 
  sufficiently small $r>0$.
\end{proof}
