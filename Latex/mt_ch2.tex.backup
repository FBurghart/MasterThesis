\chapter{Examples and Non-examples}

In this chapter, we will explore the Einstein Relation by examinating some examples and will thusly motivate some of the more general results of the next chapter.

\section{Sierpinski Gasket}

The Sierpinski Gasket is a simple example of an iterated function fractal and can be described according to theorem \ref{thm:hutchinson} as the unique non-empty compact set $\SG\ssq\IR^2$ which is invariant under the three similitudes 
\[
  S_1(x,y)=\left(\frac{x}{2},\frac{y}{2}\right),\ 
  S_2(x,y)=\left(\frac{x+1}{2},\frac{y}{2}\right),\ 
  S_3(x,y)=\left(\frac{2x+1}{4},\frac{2y+\sqrt{3}}{4}\right),
\]
see PICTURE! Since $\SG$ satisfies the (OSC), e.g. by taking the open equilateral triangle with corners $(0,0), (0,1)$ and $(1/2,\sqrt{3}/2)$, we obtain both $s=\dimh(\SG)=\frac{\ln 3}{\ln 2}$ and $\cH^s(\SG)\in(0,\infty)$ by a second appeal to Hutchinson's theorem.
